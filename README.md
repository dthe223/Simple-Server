# Simple-Server

* Many services are provided over the Internet by means of communication between clients and servers. These services include the secure shell, the network time service, and e-mail. Many "cloud" services such as file storage also fit into this category.  
* In this project, you will write your own service called simple. The goal of this project is to help you understand the basics about network programming. The project consists of two parts.  
* There are four client applications that make various requests to the server.  
* Uses the RIO library calls (such as open_clientfd(), open_listenfd(), Rio_writen(), Rio_readnb()), which can be found in the files 'csapp.c' and 'csapp.h' [here](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/public/code.html).
